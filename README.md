# Caesar-cipher-solver

### WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT SETUP

1. Download and extract the zip
2. download from the internet a file of all the words in english and call it words.txt (i used https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkPython2/blob/master/code/words.txt, although it needs 'i' and 'a' added as words)
3. edit the python file and in the 4th line where it says 'path to your words.txt file' change the text in quotes to the path to words.txt
4. run the script, if you get the error 'theshift' is not defined, its because there is a word in the text which is not in the wordlist
